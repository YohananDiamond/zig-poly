# zig-poly

Another attempt at zig polymorphism.

Main inspiration (I literally technically part of the code from there):
https://github.com/alexnask/interface.zig

I'm not even sure if this is adding anything significantly better than
what's already on `interface.zig` but at least I think I'm learning
stuff more this way.
